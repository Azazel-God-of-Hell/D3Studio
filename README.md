A brand new, and heavily improved Diablo 3 (RoS/Eternal) editor.

Downloads can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/Tonic-Box/D3Studio/releases/latest).  

Note:
To clear up some confusion and rumors. The contributors listed in the editor contributed ideas and modding knowledge soley. I (TonicBox) am, the sole developer of this project and anyone who claims otherwise is:  
A) Struggling with ego issues  
B) Trying to infect you with maliciously altered code  
C) Trying to charge you for a free software
